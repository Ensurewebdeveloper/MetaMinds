# MetaMinds Protocol

**The Decentralized Future of AI**  
MetaMinds is an open-source, community-governed AI platform that runs entirely on decentralized infrastructure. It empowers users to interact with intelligent assistants while contributing to and benefiting from the protocol through token incentives.

## 🚀 Overview

MetaMinds combines the power of blockchain, decentralized compute, and open-source AI to redefine what intelligent agents can be. Unlike traditional AI platforms, MetaMinds is:

- 🛡️ **Privacy-Focused**: End-to-end encrypted queries with zero-knowledge proofs.
- 🌍 **Decentralized**: No single point of control. Powered by global compute.
- 💎 **Tokenized**: Earn $MIND tokens by contributing compute or improving models.
- 🔓 **Open-Source**: Fully auditable, forkable, and community-driven.
